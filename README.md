# City Procedural Generator

I made a city procedural generator on c++ with openGl. Every aspect of the city is generated randomly (Size, streets, Textures). The size of the city is arround 500 to 30 000 buildings . 


# Libraries
-GLM
-SOIL
-OpenGl


## Camera
I use a projection camera with basics controls :
|Control|Action |
|--|--|
|  w|  Move foward|
|  s|  Move backward|
|  a|  Move left|
|  d|  Move right|
|  x|  Go down|
|  z|  Go up|
|  r|  Recreate a new city|

## Gaussian function
I use gaussian function. More  buildings are in the center, better are the chance that buldings are higher.
